                <blockquote>
                    Bananas are godly-heavenly fruits and they should be eaten at all times, regardless of whether its fruit is ripe, not ripe, ripe and not ripe. This would include all varieties of bananas. I recommend you to try bananas even if its its not ripe, because if the Banana is not ripe, but still has fruit in its fruit stem, then you can use it as a substitute in the dishes or even in your recipes.

                <p>Everyone knows that bananas are awesome. You know that, we know that, and that is enough to prove that a banana being <span class='theBestFruit'>the best fruit</span> isn't simply subjective, but pure, scientific fact. We promise, that is enough. If you are curious for more, please keep reading, as you are about to be enlightened, and will learn much about the great and all powerful banana.</p>

                    <p>
                        Some would say that the banana is a gift from God himself. While we all know the
                        <a href='#religion'>story of Adam and Eve, which you can find below in the religion section</a>, there are more practical theories as to how the banana came into existence. The banana we know and love today came from a time around the dinosaurs, or more specifically, around the time the dinosaurs were wiped out around 66 million years ago. You see, bananas are an out of this world fruit, not just because of how great they are, but because of where they come from.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        66 million years ago, a meteor collided with Earth, right off the coast of what we know today as the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. That meteor contained the alien seeds for what we know today as the common banana. So perfect in its design that it hasn't change since it first took root in Mexico. It did not take long for this wonderful fruit to spread all over the equator, as its plants prefer tropical climates. Today, this alien fruit is enjoyed all over the world, whether it is packed in a young student's lunchbox, baked into a bread, or used to cure disease.

                    <p>
                        The common banana has the best flavor ever. When they are nice and yellow they are sweet and super "bananish". Bananish is a word we here at <span class='theBestFruit'>The Best Fruit</span> made up because there was no word wonderful enough to describe the flavor of a banana - no other word we deem worthy. The banana tastes bananish, and it is just lovely.

                    <h2>Religion</h2>
                    <p>You remember the story of Adam and Eve, where Eve ruined everything by eating an apple from the forbidden tree? You know why God forbade them from eating from that tree? It has been theorized by Christian scientists that the reason the tree was forbidden, was because apples were an experimental fruit that man was never destined to suffer the experience of eating. In the Garden of Eden, there were beautiful banana trees of all shapes and sizes! God said to Adam and Eve,

                        <br><br><q>You can eat from any of the trees in the garden, because they are all banana trees, and the banana is <span class='theBestFruit'>the best fruit</span>. The forbidden fruit tree fruit is terrible. I wouldn't recommend it. -10/10</q>.<br><br>

                       You can blame all the world's problems on the apple tree, which God should have sent straight to his boy Lucifer because that fruit was whack. It was not God who punished Adam and Eve, but the apple itself; a common misconception. He stated himself that the banana was indeed <span class='theBestFruit'>the best fruit</span>, so how can you argue?
